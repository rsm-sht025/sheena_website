<p>The experiment aims to investigate the effect of matching donations on charitable giving. It randomly assigns individuals to treatment (matching) and control (no matching) groups and varies the match ratio and threshold to assess their impact on donation behavior.</p>
<p>The dataset contains information about the treatment assignment, match ratio, threshold, suggested donation amounts, and various demographic and historical giving variables for each individual.</p>
<p>The t-test and linear regression results show no significant difference in months since last donation between the treatment and control groups, indicating a balanced randomization. Table 1 in the paper is included to demonstrate the success of the randomization process.</p>
<p>The barplot visually compares the proportion of individuals who donated in the treatment and control groups.</p>
<p>The t-test and linear regression results indicate a statistically significant difference in the proportion of individuals who made a donation between the treatment and control groups. This suggests that matching donations positively influences the likelihood of making a charitable contribution.</p>
<p>The probit regression results confirm the findings from the linear regression, showing a significant positive effect of the treatment on the probability of making a donation.</p>
<p>The t-test results suggest that all match rates (1:1, 2:1, and 3:1) significantly increase the likelihood of donating compared to the control group. However, there is no clear evidence that higher match rates (2:1 or 3:1) are more effective than the 1:1 match rate.</p>
<p>The regression with ratio dummies confirms that all match rates have a significant positive effect on the likelihood of donating. The coefficients for ratio2 and ratio3 are not statistically different from ratio1, suggesting no incremental benefit of higher match rates.</p>
<p>The response rate differences between match ratios, calculated directly from the data and from the regression coefficients, are small and not statistically significant. This suggests that increasing the match ratio beyond 1:1 does not lead to a substantial increase in the likelihood of donating.</p>
<p>The t-test and linear regression results show a significant difference in the average donation amount between the treatment and control groups. However, this analysis includes both donors and non-donors, which may not provide a clear picture of the treatment effect on donation amount.</p>
<p>The analysis for donors only reveals no significant difference in the average donation amount between the treatment and control groups. The treatment coefficient in the linear regression does not have a causal interpretation, as it is conditional on the decision to donate, which is itself affected by the treatment.</p>
<p>The histograms of donation amounts for donors in the treatment and control groups show similar distributions, with the average donation amounts (indicated by the red vertical lines) being close to each other.</p>
<p>The plot demonstrates the Law of Large Numbers, showing that the cumulative average difference between the treatment and control groups converges to the true difference in means (0.022 - 0.018 = 0.004) as the number of draws increases.</p>
<p>The histograms illustrate the Central Limit Theorem, showing that as the sample size increases, the distribution of the average difference between the treatment and control groups becomes more normal and centered around the true difference in means (0.004). At smaller sample sizes, zero (the red vertical line) is closer to the middle of the distribution, while at larger sample sizes, zero moves towards the tail, indicating that the observed difference is less likely to be due to chance.</p>
<p>Summary: The analysis of the experiment can be broken down into several key components. First, the data is read into R/Python and described, with a balance test performed to ensure the treatment and control groups are not significantly different on key variables. Next, the effect of matched donations on the response rate of making a donation can be analyzed using bar plots, t-tests, linear regression, and probit regression. The effectiveness of different match rates can be assessed using t-tests and regression, with the response rate differences between match ratios calculated directly from the data and from regression coefficients. The effect of matched donations on the size of the charitable contribution can be analyzed using t-tests and linear regression, both for all individuals and for only those who made a donation. Histograms of donation amounts can be plotted for the treatment and control groups.</p>
<p>Finally, simulation can be used to demonstrate the Law of Large Numbers and the Central Limit Theorem, with plots of the cumulative average difference and histograms of average differences at different sample sizes. The results of these analyses can provide insights into the effectiveness of matched donations and the impact of different match rates on charitable giving behavior.</p>
<p>The experiment conducted by Karlan and List (2007) provides valuable insights into the effects of matching donations on charitable giving behavior. By randomly assigning individuals to treatment and control groups and varying the match ratio and threshold, the researchers were able to isolate the impact of these factors on donation decisions.</p>
<p>The analysis of the data reveals that the treatment, which involved offering matching donations, had a significant positive effect on the likelihood of making a charitable contribution. The t-test and linear regression results indicate a statistically significant difference in the proportion of individuals who made a donation between the treatment and control groups. This finding suggests that matching donations can be an effective strategy for encouraging people to give to charity.</p>
<p>Further investigation into the effects of different match rates (1:1, 2:1, and 3:1) shows that all match rates significantly increase the likelihood of donating compared to the control group. However, the results do not provide clear evidence that higher match rates are more effective than the 1:1 match rate. The regression with ratio dummies confirms this finding, as the coefficients for the 2:1 and 3:1 match rates are not statistically different from the 1:1 match rate. Additionally, the response rate differences between match ratios, calculated directly from the data and from the regression coefficients, are small and not statistically significant. This suggests that increasing the match ratio beyond 1:1 may not lead to a substantial increase in the likelihood of donating.</p>
<p>When examining the impact of matching donations on the size of the charitable contribution, the t-test and linear regression results initially show a significant difference in the average donation amount between the treatment and control groups. However, this analysis includes both donors and non-donors, which may not provide a clear picture of the treatment effect on donation amount. When focusing solely on donors, the analysis reveals no significant difference in the average donation amount between the treatment and control groups. It is important to note that the treatment coefficient in the linear regression for donors does not have a causal interpretation, as it is conditional on the decision to donate, which is itself affected by the treatment.</p>
<p>The histograms of donation amounts for donors in the treatment and control groups show similar distributions, with the average donation amounts being close to each other. This visual representation supports the finding that matching donations may not have a significant impact on the size of the contribution among those who decide to donate.</p>
<p>The simulation experiments conducted in the study demonstrate the Law of Large Numbers and the Central Limit Theorem. The Law of Large Numbers plot shows that the cumulative average difference between the treatment and control groups converges to the true difference in means as the number of draws increases. The Central Limit Theorem histograms illustrate that as the sample size increases, the distribution of the average difference between the treatment and control groups becomes more normal and centered around the true difference in means. These simulations provide a deeper understanding of the statistical properties underlying the observed results.</p>
<p>In conclusion, the experiment by Karlan and List (2007) offers evidence that matching donations can be an effective tool for increasing the likelihood of charitable giving. However, the results suggest that higher match rates may not necessarily lead to a significant increase in donation rates or amounts compared to a 1:1 match rate. The findings of this study can inform the strategies employed by charities and policymakers to encourage charitable giving, while also highlighting the importance of careful analysis and interpretation of data when assessing the impact of such interventions.</p>
