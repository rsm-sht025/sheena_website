I specialize in bridging the gap between deep data analytics and high-stakes infrastructure operations for industry leaders like Apple, Intuit, and Qualcomm.



Generative AI & LLMs: Deep technical understanding of Large Language Model (LLM) ecosystems, including Gemini, Anthropic (Claude), and OpenAI (GPT) architectures, with a focus on enterprise-level integration.

A common mistake in the current landscape is the rush to digitalize or spend on redundant AI solutions when the answer is often already in your data. 

### Career Highlights

* Sourcing: Managed 67M annual global spend Virtual Expert Platform at Intuit.
* Operations: Achieved a 1.5M annual cost reduction while leading technical teams at Apple.
* Supply Chain: Restructured microelectronics strategies for patented chip technologies, reducing time-to-market costs by up to 94%.
* Predictive Modeling: Improved Qualcomm cycle-time forecasting accuracy from 60% to 85%.
